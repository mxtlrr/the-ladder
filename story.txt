The Ladder.


The day is 04/24/1966. You are a test-subject for the U.S. Army's
new project. They say you will be conpensated very well for your
participation.

You are injected with a synringe, which they say contains a substance
known only as "BZ". You have no idea what it is, and you aren't allowed
to ask any questions.

Your task for the day is to help the army officials see the effects
of BZ on a walking subject (that's you!). To do this, they've lead you
to an undisclosed location, where before you, is a dark and dimly lit
staircase.

You are equipped with the following items:
- 4 protein bars
- A walkie talkie, to communicate with officials
- 3 16oz (473mL) bottles of water

The task is clear: Walk down the staircase and cooperate with the officials.
However, a problem arises!

BZ is a deliriant, causing extreme hallucinations and agitations. But
you don't know that! You think this is just some opiate, but it isn't.

The door behind you is locked, and you have no way of progressing, other
than descending. As you descend deeper into the stairwell, "BZ" kicks in.

The hallucinations from the deliriant drug get worse as you descend. You
can't tell real from fake, and you're getting extremely weak and can
barely do simple tasks.


Will you make it to the end, if there even is one? Or will you die trying,
and be forgotten by everyone?
