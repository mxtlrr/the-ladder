The ladder is an experimental horror game. It is a mix
of [SCP-087](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-087)[-B](https://www.scpcbgame.com/scp-087-b.html),
and the drug [BZ, 3-QNB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Quinuclidinyl_benzilate). BZ is a drug invented by the US Army in the 1960s
as a non-fatal incapacitating agent.

You can find the story about the game [here](./story.txt).
